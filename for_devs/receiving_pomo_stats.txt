Setting up your ghost to receive pomogaka stats should be fairly easy. Once an hour, at the top of the hour, pomogaka broadcasts stats as a notifyother command to all open ghosts, calling the event "OnPomoStatsReceive" and passing several variables to it. 

You can also have your ghost ping pomogaka at any time using "\![raiseother,Pomogaka,OnPomoStatsBroadcast]", and it will return the same data as the hourly ping, but with a raiseother command so you can have your ghost comment on it.

Pomogaka will also broadcast stats as a notifyother command to a ghost that is booted or changed to while pomogaka is open.

reference0 is the total amount of sessions the user has done
reference1 is the total amount of minutes the user has spent in sessions
reference2 is the amount of sessions the user has done today
reference3 is the amount of minutes the user has spent in sessions today

Daily amounts are reset at midnight by default, but users can change the daily reset time at will. 

An example implementation in a ghost that uses YAYA could look like this:

OnPomoReceiveStats {
    
    _dailysessions = reference2
    _dailyminutes = reference3
    
    //This will display only if the ghost pings pomogaka directly, and not on the hourly/boot notifications
    if _dailysessions > 8 || _dailyminutes > 200 {
        "\0\s[0]You've been really focused today,\w4 %(username)."
    }
    
}

Something like that! Of course, you could get really creative, like storing the stats in a variable to keep track of a "high score" of sorts, or have your ghost celebrate the user for reaching certain milestones. Whatever you want really. If theres another stat you want me to broadcast/keep track of for your ghosts needs, shoot me an email at yuyugamedev@gmail.com :-)
